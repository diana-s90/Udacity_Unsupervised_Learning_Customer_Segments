# Project: Identify Customer Segments
## Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree
### Unsupervised Learning

In this project, real-life data of a mail-order sales company in Germany was used. The main question of interest was to 
identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 
The project's main idea was to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, 
then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. 
Prior to applying the machine learning methods, some cleaning steps were required.

#### Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and python libraries:
numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
